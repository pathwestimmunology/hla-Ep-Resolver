# hla-Ep-Resolver: A novel web-based bioinformatic tool to determine the presence or absence of DSA against rare HLA alleles in the era of rapid high-resolution deceased donor HLA genotyping.

Patients awaiting a solid organ transplant require a pre-transplant testing including high-resolution HLA typing and screening of HLA antibodies using the Single Antigen Bead (SAB) assay. However, the standard antigen panel in the SAB assay cannot encompass all the HLA antigens available in the Australian donor pool. With the advent of high-resolution HLA typing for deceased donor work-up, there is an increased prevalence of detecting uncommon HLA alleles. Therefore, it is challenging to determine whether patients on the transplant waiting list have donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) against these antigens. To address this issue, a bioinformatic pipeline, hla-Ep-Resolver, was developed to predict rare HLA unacceptable antigens (UAs) that are not present in the standard SAB assay.
